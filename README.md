# WZScraper
A Multi-threaded LoL Scraper

This is a open source multi-thread League of Legends scraper. The reason I created this is cause all the rest didn't really made good use of threads and tasks.

# How to use:
1. You select the site you wanna scrape.
2. You pick a region.
3. Select a start page number and end page number.
4. Press scrape!
5. After it is completed you choose which export method you want and press export!

# Requires:
.NET Framework v4.5.1
